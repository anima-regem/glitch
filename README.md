## Product Overview
Glitch helps people plan less, do more, and recover quickly on low-energy days. It is built for users who want daily momentum without noisy dashboards, aggressive gamification, or account-heavy workflows.

## What You Use It For
- Running focused daily sessions on one task at a time.
- Managing chores, habits, and project work in one lightweight app.
- Tracking completion history with reflective, non-punitive feedback.
- Planning tomorrow with minimal friction at the end of the day.

## Core Features
- **Focus tab**
  - Single-task card flow with clear `Start focus`, `Pause`, and `Mark complete` actions.
  - Dedicated run mode with timer continuity.
  - Daily completion state with a fast path to create the next task.
- **Lists tab**
  - Unified task organization across `Chores`, `Habits`, and `Projects`.
  - Quick-create and edit workflows for each list type.
- **Done tab**
  - Completion heatmap for daily consistency visibility.
  - Weekly reflection summary with recovery-first tone.
- **Settings tab**
  - Appearance controls (theme, contrast, text scaling).
  - Reminder controls (opt-in behavior).
  - Backup vault setup, sync controls, and restore access.
  - About, repository, release checks, and support links.
- **Local-first architecture**
  - Data remains on-device by default.
  - Encrypted backup and restore workflow for portability.
